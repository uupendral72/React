cloning , forking, branching,merging:

cloning is the copy that you download from a repository
git clone link

forking is the copy repository created with synchronisation to the main repository.

for open source contribution, follow below steps:
fork the original repository , it will make your copy repository
clone your copy repository into VScode
do the changes
add to git, commit and push to your copy repository
create a pull request to the original repository for merging your code
once it is accepted, your code will be merged and you are a contributor now

branches contains individual code segments which can be merged as per requirements. it helps in managing multiple use cases or environments

create a new branch : git branch branch-name
goto the branch : git checkout branchname
