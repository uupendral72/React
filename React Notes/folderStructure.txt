In React, all components follows a structure called JSX(Javascript Extensible). It is the combination of HTML+JS.
  JSX Rules:
     1. Attribute should follow camelCase
     2. JSX should return only one Parent Element. In case of multiple elements needed to be returned, wrap them in a container
     3. In case of dynamic values of JS in HTML, keep them in braces - {}
     4. In case HTML in JS, keep them in paranthesis - ()
     5. Styles can be represnted as objects
